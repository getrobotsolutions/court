				              		<p><em>Sulfonamide Hypersensitivity Reactions</em> - AZOPT<sup class="reg">&reg;</sup> Suspension is a sulfonamide and although administered topically it is absorbed systemically. Therefore, the same types of adverse reactions that are attributable to sulfonamides may occur with topical administration of AZOPT<sup class="reg">&reg;</sup> Suspension. Fatalities have occurred, although rarely, due to severe reactions to sulfonamides including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, fulminant hepatic necrosis, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and other blood dyscrasias.

				              		<h3>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h3>
				              		<p>In clinical studies of AZOPT<sup class="reg">&reg;</sup> Suspension, the most frequently reported adverse reactions reported in 5 to 10% of patients were blurred vision and bitter, sour or unusual taste. Adverse reactions occurring in 1 to 5% of patients were blepharitis, dermatitis, dry eye, foreign body sensation, headache, hyperemia, ocular discharge, ocular discomfort, ocular keratitis, ocular pain, ocular pruritus and rhinitis. </p>

				              		<p><em>Oral Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors</em> - There is a potential for an additive effect on the known systemic effects of carbonic anhydrase inhibition in patients receiving an oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and AZOPT<sup class="reg">&reg;</sup> Suspension.
