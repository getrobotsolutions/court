<!-- 				              	<div id="isi-indication">
				             		<h3>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h3>
				              		<p>TRAVATAN Z<sup class="reg">&reg;</sup> (travoprost ophthalmic solution) 0.004% is indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. </p>
				              		<h3>Dosage and Administration </h3>
				              		<p>The recommended dosage is one drop in the affected eye(s) once daily in the evening. TRAVATAN Z<sup class="reg">&reg;</sup> Solution should not be administered more than once daily since it has been  shown that more frequent administration of prostaglandin analogs may decrease the IOP lowering effect.</p>
				              		<p>TRAVATAN Z<sup class="reg">&reg;</sup> Solution may be used concomitantly with other topical ophthalmic drug products to lower IOP. If more than one topical ophthalmic drug is being used, the drugs should be administered at least 5 minutes apart. </p>

The long-term effects of increased pigmentation are not known. While treatment with TRAVATAN Z<sup class="reg">&reg;</sup> Solution can be continued in patients who develop noticeably increased iris pigmentation, these patients should be examined regularly.</p> -->
				              		<p><em>Eyelash Changes</em> - TRAVATAN Z<sup class="reg">&reg;</sup> Solution may gradually change eyelashes and vellus hair in the treated eye. These changes include increased length, thickness, and number of lashes. Eyelash changes are usually reversible upon discontinuation of treatment. </p>	
				              		<p><em>Intraocular Inflammation</em> - TRAVATAN Z<sup class="reg">&reg;</sup> Solution should be used with caution in patients with active intraocular inflammation (e.g. uveitis) because the inflammation may be exacerbated. </p>
				              		<p><em>Macular Edema</em> - Macular edema, including cystoid macular edema, has been reported during treatment with travoprost ophthalmic solution.

				              		<p><em>Bacterial Keratitis</em> - There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of multiple-dose containers of topical ophthalmic products. These containers had been inadvertently contaminated by patients who, in most cases, had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface. </p>
				              		<p><em>Use with Contact Lenses</em> - Contact lenses should be removed prior to instillation of TRAVATAN Z<sup class="reg">&reg;</sup> Solution and may be reinserted 15 minutes following its administration.</p>

			              		<p>TRAVATAN Z<sup class="reg">&reg;</sup> (travoprost ophthalmic solution) 0.004% is indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. </p>
			              		<h3>Dosage and Administration </h3>
			              		<p>The recommended dosage is one drop in the affected eye(s) once daily in the evening. TRAVATAN Z<sup class="reg">&reg;</sup> Solution should not be administered more than once daily since it has been  shown that more frequent administration of prostaglandin analogs may decrease the IOP lowering effect.</p>
			              		<p>TRAVATAN Z<sup class="reg">&reg;</sup> Solution may be used concomitantly with other topical ophthalmic drug products to lower IOP. If more than one topical ophthalmic drug is being used, the drugs should be administered at least 5 minutes apart. </p>

			              		<h3>Warnings and Precautions</h3>
			              		<p><em>Pigmentation</em> - Travoprost ophthalmic solution has been reported to increase the pigmentation of the iris, periorbital tissue (eyelid), and eyelashes. Pigmentation is expected to increase as long as travoprost is administered. After discontinuation of travoprost, pigmentation of the iris is likely to be permanent, while pigmentation of the periorbital tissue and eyelash changes have been reported to be reversible in some patients. The long-term effects of increased pigmentation are not known. While treatment with TRAVATAN Z<sup class="reg">&reg;</sup> Solution can be continued in patients who develop noticeably increased iris pigmentation, these patients should be examined regularly.</p>
